# Simple Interest Calculator

This project calculates simple interest using the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## Formula
SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest
- T = Time (in years)

## Example
If:
- Principal = 2000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 4 years

Simple Interest = (2000 × 5 × 4) / 100 = 400
